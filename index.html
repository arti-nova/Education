       <h2>History of education</h2>

       <p>The history of civilization started in the Middle East about 3000 bce, whereas the North China civilization began about a millennium and a half later.<strong> The Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations</strong> flourished almost simultaneously during the first civilizational phase (3000â€“1500 bce). Although these civilizations differed, they shared monumental literary achievements.<br>The need for the perpetuation of these highly developed civilizations made writing and formal education indispensable.
